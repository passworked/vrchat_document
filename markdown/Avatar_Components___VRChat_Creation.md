VRChat's Avatars SDK contains a suite of features to create fun and exciting interactions between avatars.

*   [PhysBones](https://creators.vrchat.com/avatars/avatar-dynamics/physbones)
     allows bones to be affected by physics or by other players.
*   [Contacts](https://creators.vrchat.com/avatars/avatar-dynamics/contacts)
     can detect collisions to trigger animations or effects.
*   [Constraints](https://creators.vrchat.com/avatars/avatar-dynamics/constraints)
     copies the movement of bones on your avatar.
*   [Head Chop](https://creators.vrchat.com/avatars/avatar-dynamics/vrc-headchop)
     allows you to hide or show bones from your first-person view.

PhysBones and Contacts are governed by the [Permissions and Settings](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/permissions-and-settings)
 system, which gives you complete control over who can interact with you.
